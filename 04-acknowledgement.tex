First and foremost, I extend my deepest gratitude to my PhD advisor, Prof. Vishal M. Patel, for graciously accepting me as his PhD student at Johns Hopkins University. His unwavering inspiration and encouragement have been pivotal in shaping my academic journey and nurturing my aspirations.

I am equally grateful to my committee members, Prof. Rama Chellappa and Prof. Alan Yuille, whose extraordinary contributions to the field have profoundly influenced and guided my own research endeavors.

I also wish to extend my sincere thanks to Mauricio Delbracio, Hossein Talebi, and Peyman Milanfar for hosting me at Google Research in Mountain View during 2023 and 2024. Collaborating on the paper exploring diffusion distillation, diffusion scaling properties, and multimodal super-resolution was a true privilege.

Additionally, my heartfelt appreciation goes to my family, collaborators, labmates, and friends, whose unwavering support has made this journey possible.

Lastly, I want to acknowledge my younger self for choosing to embark on this challenging yet rewarding life experience.
